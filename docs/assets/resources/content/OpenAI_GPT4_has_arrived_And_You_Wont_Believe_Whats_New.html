<p>On March 14, 2023, OpenAI released its latest AI model, GPT-4, which has already generated a lot of buzz in the AI community.</p>

    <p>The Livestream demonstrating the new model was held at 1pm on the same day. If you missed it, you can watch the recording here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/outcGtbnMuQ?feature=share">https://www.youtube.com/live/outcGtbnMuQ?feature=share</a></p>

    <h2>New Features</h2>

    <p>GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that can accept both text and images as input and generate text outputs based on these inputs. This new model has improved reliability, creativity, and handling of nuanced instructions compared to its predecessor, GPT-3.5. It has shown similar capabilities to text-only inputs in the research preview stage.</p>

    <p>In addition to its impressive language abilities, GPT-4 also has increased steerability. Developers can prescribe their AI's style and task by describing the directions in the "system" message. API users can customize their users' experience within bounds, allowing for significant personalization.</p>

    <h2>Improvements</h2>

    <p>OpenAI has made many improvements to GPT-4 to make it safer than GPT-3.5. They engaged with over 50 experts to adversarially test the model and collected additional data to improve GPT-4's ability to refuse dangerous requests. GPT-4 is 82% less likely to give inappropriate content than the previous version, and it follows policies better regarding sensitive topics like medical advice and self-harm.</p>

    <h2>Dangers</h2>

    <p>While GPT-4's capabilities are significant, it poses new risks, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. OpenAI has been working to mitigate these risks and continues to engage with experts to improve the model's safety.</p>

    <p>It is important to be cautious when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts. GPT-4 can still "hallucinate" facts and make reasoning errors, and it doesn't know about events after September 2021, which can cause it to make simple reasoning errors and accept false statements as true.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect in the Future</h2>

    <p>GPT-4's release marks a significant milestone in AI development. OpenAI plans to continue improving GPT-4's capabilities and safety while also exploring new areas of research.</p>

    <p>As with any new technology, it will take time to fully understand the impact of GPT-4 on society. However, it is clear that this new model has the potential to be both helpful and harmful. It is up to researchers, developers, and users to work together to ensure that GPT-4 is used responsibly and ethically.</p>

    

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>In conclusion, the release of GPT-4 is a significant advancement in the field of AI and natural language processing. Its human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, ability to handle both text and visual inputs, and increased steerability make it a powerful tool for developers and researchers alike. However, with its new capabilities also come new risks, and caution should be taken when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts. OpenAI has been working to mitigate these risks and improve the safety of GPT-4, but there is still more work to be done. It will be interesting to see how GPT-4 is further developed and applied in the future, and what new possibilities it may unlock.</p>
