<p>Angular is a popular JavaScript framework used to build complex web applications. It allows developers to create
  components, services, directives and modules to make the web app more responsive and organized. However, beginners
  often make mistakes while creating these elements and it is important to know the difference between beginner mistakes
  and pro usage to get the most out of Angular.</p><h2>Components</h2><p>Components are logical entities that allow developers to separate functionality into manageable chunks. Beginners
  often make the mistake of writing too much logic in the component class, making it difficult to maintain and test. Pro
  usage of components involves breaking down the functionality into smaller chunks and writing the logic in the service
  class.</p><h2>Services</h2><p>Services are classes that allow developers to centralize the business logic and share it between components.
  Beginners often write complex logic within the services, making it hard to maintain and test. Pro usage of services
  involves breaking down the logic into smaller functions, which can be easily tested and reused.</p><h2>Directives</h2><p>Directives are attributes that are used to inject additional behaviour into an element. Beginners often make the
  mistake of over-complicating the directive logic, making it hard to maintain and test. Pro usage of directives
  involves writing small, re-usable functions that can be easily tested and reused.</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>Modules are containers for different parts of the application. Beginners often make the mistake of including too much
  logic in the module, making it hard to maintain and test. Pro usage of modules involves breaking down the
  functionality into smaller chunks and writing the logic in the service class.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Angular components, services, directives and modules are powerful tools for building complex web applications.
  Beginners often make mistakes while creating these elements and it is important to know the difference between
  beginner mistakes and pro usage to get the most out of Angular.</p><p>To learn more about the basics of Angular, take a look at this <a href="https://angular.io/guide/architecture">guide
