  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In the world of Artificial Intelligence, there are many complex concepts that can be difficult to understand. Two
    of these concepts are layers and parameters. In this article, we will explain these concepts using a simple analogy:
    baking a cake.</p>

  <h2>The Cake Analogy</h2>
  <p>Imagine you are baking a cake. The first thing you do is gather all the ingredients: flour, sugar, eggs, milk, etc.
    These ingredients are like the input data in an AI system. Just like how you need the right ingredients to make a
    cake, an AI system needs the right data to make accurate predictions.</p><img

  <p>Next, you mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. This mixing process is like the first layer in an AI system.
    The first layer takes in the input data and performs a simple computation on it. It's like mixing the ingredients
    together to make a batter.</p><img src="https://i.insider.com/62587bde6e3336001926b746?width=700"

  <p>After mixing, you pour the batter into a baking pan and put it in the oven. The baking pan and oven are like the
    other layers in an AI system. Each layer takes in the output from the previous layer and performs a more complex
    computation on it. Just like how the oven bakes the cake and changes its structure, the layers in an AI system
    transform the input data into something more meaningful.</p><img src="https://c.stocksy.com/a/M4G300/z9/776758.jpg"

  <p>Finally, after the cake is baked, you can add frosting, sprinkles, or other decorations. These decorations are like
    the parameters in an AI system. Parameters are values that the system learns through a training process. They allow
    the AI system to make more accurate predictions by adjusting the output of each layer.</p><img

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Layers and parameters are two important concepts in Artificial Intelligence. By understanding these concepts using
    the cake analogy, we can see how each layer in an AI system transforms the input data into something more
    meaningful. The parameters then allow the system to fine-tune its predictions for greater accuracy.</p>
