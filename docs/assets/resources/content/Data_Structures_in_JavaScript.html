<p>JavaScript offers a number of different data structures to store and organize data. The most common data structures
  are Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables. Each of these data structures has its own advantages
  and disadvantages and can be used to solve different types of problems.</p><h2>Linked Lists</h2><p>A linked list is a collection of nodes, each of which contains a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.
  Linked lists are a useful data structure for representing sequences of data, such as a list of items or a sequence of
  instructions. They are also used to store sparse data, such as a sparse matrix. An example of a linked list in
  JavaScript is:</p><pre>var list = { head: { value: 2, next: { value: 4, next: { value: 6, next: null } } } };</pre><h2>Stacks</h2><p>A stack is a data structure that follows the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO). Items are added to the top of
  the stack and removed from the top of the stack. Stacks are most commonly used for keeping track of function calls or
  for implementing undo/redo operations. An example of a stack in JavaScript is:</p><pre>var stack = { top: { value: 2, next: { value: 4, next: { value: 6, next: null } } } };</pre><h2>Queues</h2><p>A queue is a data structure that follows the principle of First In, First Out (FIFO). Items are added to the back of
  the queue and removed from the front of the queue. Queues are most commonly used for keeping track of tasks or for
  implementing message passing. An example of a queue in JavaScript is:</p><pre>var queue = { front: { value: 2, next: { value: 4, next: { value: 6, next: null } } } };</pre><h2>Trees</h2><p>A tree is a data structure that is used to store hierarchical data. It consists of nodes, which can have child nodes.
  Trees are most commonly used for representing the structure of a file system or for representing the structure of a
  directed graph. An example of a tree in JavaScript is:</p><pre>var tree = { value: 2, children: [ { value: 4, children: [ { value: 6, children: [] } ] } ] };</pre><h2>Graphs</h2><p>A graph is a data structure that is used to store data that is related in some way. A graph consists of nodes and
  edges, which connect the nodes. Graphs are most commonly used for representing networks or for representing the
  structure of a web page. An example of a graph in JavaScript is:</p><pre>var graph = { nodes: [ { value: 2 }, { value: 4 }, { value: 6 } ], edges: [ { from: 0, to: 1 }, { from: 0, to: 2 } ] };</pre><h2>Hash Tables</h2><p>A hash table is a data structure that is used to store data in a key-value format. It is used for fast lookups of
  data, as it allows for quick access to a value when given a key. An example of a hash table in JavaScript is:</p><pre>var hashTable = { 2: "foo", 4: "bar", 6: "baz" };</pre><p>These are just a few of the different data structures that are available in JavaScript. Each of these data structures
  has its own advantages and disadvantages, and they can be used to solve different types of problems. Understanding
  which data structure to use for a particular problem is essential for writing efficient and maintainable code.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, data structures in JavaScript offer a variety of ways to store and organize data. Linked Lists,
  Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables are the most common data structures and can be used to solve different
  types of problems. Understanding which data structure to use for a particular problem is essential for writing
  efficient and maintainable code.</p>
