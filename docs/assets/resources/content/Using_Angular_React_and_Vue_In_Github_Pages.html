<h1>Using Angular, React, Vue in Github Pages</h1>
<p>GitHub Pages is a great service for hosting static sites, like a personal portfolio, blog, or project documentation.
  Even modern web apps are often just static HTML and Javascript. However, static sites don't allow for dynamic routes,
  such as a blog post with a dynamic parameter. All of the routes must be known in advance and point to a static file.
  To add new content, you have to re-deploy the page. </p>
  <p>With CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions/Workflows, this is a
    simple process of pushing a new markdown file to your repository. But situations call for dynamic paths when
    user-generated content and complex projects are involved.</p>
    <p>My Gihut website works this way, go ahead and check it's open source code in this <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RicardoRibeirorr/RicardoRibeirorr.github.io">Github Repository</a></p>

<h2>What is a Hash for Dynamic Routes in Web Development?</h2>
<p>Dynamic routes are an important aspect of web development, and they have become increasingly popular in modern
  frameworks. Hash routing is a method used to create dynamic routes and is commonly used in frameworks such as Angular
  and React. In this blog post, we'll dive into what a hash for dynamic routes is, how to implement it in Angular and
  React, and the advantages of using this technique.</p>

<h2>What is a Hash for Dynamic Routes?</h2>
<p>A hash for dynamic routes is essentially a unique identifier for the current route that a user is on. It is created
  by appending a “#” symbol to the end of the URL. This is used to create dynamic routes that can be changed without the
  need for a full page reload. The hash is also a useful way to keep track of the user’s current route, as it can easily
  be shared or bookmarked.</p>


<h2>Advantages of Using a Hash for Dynamic Routes</h2>
<p>Using a hash for dynamic routes can be beneficial in a number of ways. By using hashes, you can create single-page
  applications that are more intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, dynamic routes can be shared more easily as the
  hash is included in the URL, allowing users to bookmark or link to specific routes. It allows you to implement new
  school frameworks into an old server or even GitHub Pages. Finally, hashes can help improve the performance of an
  application by reducing the need for full-page reloads.</p>

<h2>How do dynamic routes even work?</h2>
<em>If you are knowledgeable about the concept and would like to learn how to configure GitHub Pages to support dynamic
  routes, you can skip ahead to The Solution.</em>
<p>A route/path is traditionally pointing to a (static) file on the server that is represented by a domain.</p>
<pre>your-server.com/some/path/index.html</pre>
<p>If the file you are attempting to access is not present on the server, you may receive an error message. This
  typically results in the server serving a default 404.html page. This is likely what you have seen before:</p>

<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages does not support a front controller because it is not designed to serve dynamic content. However, you
  can still use JavaScript in your static HTML files to dynamically change its content based on user interactions. This
  is how most web apps work – they are nothing more than a static HTML file, and then JavaScript takes over. All of this
  happens in the browser, and not on GitHub's servers. So, if you try to access a file (e.g.
  your-username.github.io/some/file.html) that does not exist in your repository, you will get an error.</p>

<p>Most developers/users accept that GitHub Pages might not be the right service for them and move on to a more
  comprehensive hosting solution with more control. However, I'm a lazy minimalist and want to use just one platform
  account! Despite GitHub's default 404.html file, I'm determined to make it work!</p>

<h3>An old-fashioned alternative</h3>
<p>I initially thought I would settle for a compromise and use the # method, like the old AngularJS did, rather than
  having "real" dynamic routes. The # in the URL is not sent to the server and instead is used by the browser to jump to
  an HTML anchor. This means you can have routes that look like this:</p>
<pre>your-server.com/#/posts/&lt;post-id&gt;</pre>

<h2>How to Implement a Hash for Dynamic Routes in Angular and React</h2>
<p>Implementing a hash for dynamic routes in Angular and React is fairly straightforward. For Angular, you'll need to
  enable the <code>useHash</code> option in the <code>RouterModule</code> of your application. For React, you'll need to
  install the <code>react-router-dom</code> package and use the <code>HashRouter</code> component. You can then start
  creating dynamic routes using hashes in your application.</p>
<p><b>Now your just have to</b> Include a hash (#) before your links and redirects, as necessary. Ex:</p>
<pre>
//After With hash '#'
<a href="#/posts">Posts</a>
<a href="#/posts/1">Posts 1</a>
<a href="#/users/ricardo_ribeiro/profile">Posts 1</a>

//Before No Hash
<a href="/posts">Posts</a>
<a href="/posts/1">Posts 1</a>
<a href="/users/ricardo_ribeiro/profile">Posts 1</a>
</pre>

<small>Ensure to include a hash (#) symbol ONLY in you application routes, not the server request Url's.</small>
