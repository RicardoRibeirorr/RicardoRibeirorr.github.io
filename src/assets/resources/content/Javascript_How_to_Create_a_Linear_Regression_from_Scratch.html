<p>In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of linear regression and learn how to write a linear regression from
  scratch in JavaScript. We'll also explore gradient descent and how to implement it in JavaScript, and learn how to
  use linear regression in real-world applications. Finally, we'll discuss some tips and tricks for optimizing linear
  regression in JavaScript.</p>
<p>So let's start!</p>


<h2>Understanding the Basics of Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two or more variables. The most
  common form of linear regression is a linear regression line, which is a line drawn through a scatterplot of data
  points. It is used to predict values based on the linear relationship between the variables. In this section, we'll
  discuss the basics of linear regression, including the types of linear regression, the assumptions, and the
  mathematics behind it.</p>
<p>Linear regression is a type of statistical model that is used to understand the relationship between two variables.
  It is used to predict the value of a dependent variable (Y) based on the value of an independent variable (X).</p>
<p>The basic equation of linear regression is Y = mX + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the intercept. The
  equation of the line can be used to predict the value of Y for any given value of X.</p>
<p>Linear regression is used in a variety of applications, including forecasting, forecasting demand, price prediction,
  and risk analysis. It can also be used to identify trends in data and to develop predictive models.</p>
<p>Linear regression can be visualized as a line on a graph, as shown in the image below. The line shows the
  relationship between two variables. The slope of the line indicates how much Y changes for every unit change in X.
  The intercept is the Y-intercept, which is the value of Y when X is equal to zero.</p>

<p>Linear regression is used in many different fields, from economics to medicine. For example, in economics, linear
  regression can be used to analyze the relationship between GDP and inflation. In medicine, it can be used to predict
  the likelihood of a patient developing a particular disease.</p>
<p>Linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between two variables and can be used to
  develop predictive models. It can be used to analyze the relationship between two variables and to identify trends
  in data.</p>


<h2>Writing a Linear Regression from Scratch in JavaScript</h2>
<p>In this section, we'll explore how to write a linear regression from scratch in JavaScript. We'll look at the
  mathematics of linear regression, discuss the code for implementing a linear regression.</p>


<p>First let's create our base function/class:</p>
<pre><code>function LinearRegression() {
    //Store our data
    this.data = [];

    //Store our coefficients
    this.coefficients = {
        a: 0,
        b: 0
    };

    //Store our mean values
    this.means = {
        x: 0,
        y: 0
    };
}</code></pre>

<p>Then we will create a function to add our data points</p>
<pre>//Add data points
LinearRegression.prototype.addData = function(x, y) {
  //Add the data point to our array
  this.data.push([x, y]);
};</pre>

<p>Now let's create a function to calculate the coefficients</p>
<pre><code>//Calculate the coefficients
LinearRegression.prototype.calculateCoefficients = function() {
    //If there is no data, return
    if (this.data.length == 0) return;

    //Calculate the means
    let sumX = 0;
    let sumY = 0;

    this.data.forEach(function(point) {
        sumX += point[0];
        sumY += point[1];
    });

    this.means.x = sumX / this.data.length;
    this.means.y = sumY / this.data.length;

    //Calculate the coefficients
    let numerator = 0;
    let denominator = 0;

    this.data.forEach(function(point) {
        numerator += (point[0] - this.means.x) * (point[1] - this.means.y);
        denominator += Math.pow(point[0] - this.means.x, 2);
    }, this);

    this.coefficients.b = numerator / denominator;
    this.coefficients.a = this.means.y - (this.coefficients.b * this.means.x);
};</code></pre>

<p>Next, we will create a function to predict a y value</p>
<pre><code>//Predict y value
LinearRegression.prototype.predict = function(x) {
    //Calculate the y value
    return this.coefficients.a + (this.coefficients.b * x);
};</code></pre>



<p>Testing what we have by now, Finally! 🤌</p>
<pre><code>//Now we can use our LinearRegression
let myLR = new LinearRegression();

//Add some data points
myLR.addData(1, 2);
myLR.addData(2, 3);
myLR.addData(3, 4);

//Calculate the coefficients
myLR.calculateCoefficients();

//Predict a y value of your choose
let y = myLR.predict(4); // y should be 5</code></pre>

<h2>Taking it Further: Implementing Gradient Descent in JavaScript</h2>
<p>Your code should be working fine by now, so now what? Well, it may be working but there is a small step yet to be made
  - <b>Gradient Descent</b>.</p>
<p>Gradient descent is a powerful optimization technique used to minimize the cost of a linear regression. In this
  section, we'll explore how to implement gradient descent in JavaScript. We'll discuss the mathematics of gradient
  descent, discuss the code for implementing it in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Gradient descent in linear regression is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a linear
  model. It works by iteratively updating the parameters of the model in small steps in the opposite direction of the
  gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. This allows the cost function to be minimized, and
  thus the model to be optimized for a given set of data. By repeating this process, the model can be continually
  improved until a satisfactory level of accuracy is achieved</p>

<p>This function should be used inside the LinearRegression class, and will use the coefficients calculated by the
  calculateCoefficients function to adjust the coefficients based on the data points, making you trained data just
  perfect.</p>
<pre><code>//Implementing gradientDescent
LinearRegression.prototype.gradientDescent = function(learningRate, numIterations) {
    //Calculate the gradients
    let mGradient = 0;
    let bGradient = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++) {
        let x = this.data[i][0];
        let y = this.data[i][1];
        let error = y - (this.coefficients.a + (this.coefficients.b * x));

        mGradient += -(1 / this.data.length) * x * error;
        bGradient += -(1 / this.data.length) * error;
    }

    //Update the coefficients
    this.coefficients.a -= learningRate * bGradient;
    this.coefficients.b -= learningRate * mGradient;

    //Check for numIterations
    if (numIterations === 0) return;

    //Repeat
    this.gradientDescent(learningRate, numIterations - 1);
};</code></pre>

<p>Now Create a function to train your data.</p>
<pre>//We will create a function to train our model
LinearRegression.prototype.train = function(learningRate, numIterations) {
    //Calculate the coefficients
    this.calculateCoefficients();

    //Train the model using gradient descent
    this.gradientDescent(learningRate, numIterations);
};</pre>


<p>Testing what we have by now:</p>
<pre><code>//Create a new instance of the LinearRegression
let myLR = new LinearRegression();

//Add some data points
myLR.addData(1, 2);
myLR.addData(2, 3);
myLR.addData(3, 4);

//Train the model
myLR.train(0.001, 100);

//Predict a y value
let y = myLR.predict(4); // y should be 5</code></pre>

<h2>Tips and Tricks for Optimizing And Use Your Model</h2>
<p>Are you looking to get the most out of your linear regression model? Are you in search of effective methods to make
  the most of your linear regression model?</p>
<p>Yes, there are still some things you can do to optimize the algorithm but also the way you use your model, but don't stress, we will be very light with this, and since your code is working let's not start turning everything upside down. 
</p>

<h3>Optimizing the Model</h3>
<p>So first, let's talk about something that you may have noticed in your code  <code> myLR.train(0.001, 100); </code> -
  "what are those numbers?"</p>
<p>Those numbers, <b>"learning rate"</b> and <b>"number of iterations"</b> indicate how precise you wanna be with your results, but
  don't go rush into scalling those values to have the best results, it doesn't work like that. </p>
<p>First let's take a look of what they represent:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The learning rate</b> (also known as the step size) is a parameter used in gradient descent. It determines
    the size
    of the steps taken when updating the parameters of the model. A higher learning rate will allow the model to
    learn faster, but can also lead to divergence and instability, meaning, jumping over the target value. In the other
    hand, lower values make the model learn slower, and in some circunstances can make it also lead to divergence and
    instability</li>
  <li><b>The number of iterations</b> (also known as epochs) is another parameter used in gradient descent. It
    determines the
    number of times the algorithm will cycle through the training data before terminating. The number of iterations
    should be large enough to ensure that the model has had enough time to learn, but not so large that the model is
    overfitting the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know what they are, let's talk about those parameters should be set.</p>
<p>When setting these parameters, it's important to find the right balance. Start with a low learning rate and a high number of iterations, and gradually increase the learning rate while decreasing the number of iterations until the algorithm converges on the global minimum. The global minimum is the point in a cost function where the value is minimized. In other words, it's the point where the algorithm is able to produce the most accurate results with the least amount of steps and the higher learning rate.</p>


<h3>Optimizing The Algorithm</h3>
<p>Your algorithm it's done and working fine, but is it? A sword without cutting edges isn't really a sword is it? - I don't think so.</p>
<p>I'll be leaving a list of things you can do to optimize your code. In case you wish me to continue this as a series, just let me know in the comments or ping me on <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-ribeiro-5a788712b/">LinkedIn</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>You can optimize this code by using caching. Caching involves storing the results of expensive computations so that
    they can be reused without having to be recomputed. This can significantly reduce the time taken to run the code.
  </li>
  <li>For example, you can cache the results of the calculations done in the calculateCoefficients and gradientDescent
    functions. you could also use caching for the data points added in the addData function. This would reduce the amount
    of time taken to process the data, as the results would already be stored in memory.</li>
  <li>You could also use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the coefficients and gradients, such as using matrix
    operations or using the normal equation. This could speed up the code even further.</li>
  <li>You could also refactor the code to use a more object-oriented approach, which would make the code easier to read
    and understand, as you'll as potentially make it more efficient.</li>
</ol>
