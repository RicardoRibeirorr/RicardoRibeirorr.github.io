        <h2>What are the SOLID Principles?</h2>
        <p>The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help you write better code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>S</strong> - Single Responsibility Principle</li>
            <li><strong>O</strong> - Open/Closed Principle</li>
            <li><strong>L</strong> - Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
            <li><strong>I</strong> - Interface Segregation Principle</li>
            <li><strong>D</strong> - Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
        </ul>

  <h2>Master the Single Responsibility Principle - Turbocharge Your Code Efficiency!</h2>

        <p>Are you tired of dealing with bloated, tangled code that's impossible to maintain? Do you dream of writing code that's clean, focused, and easy to understand?</p>
        
        <p>Introducing the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - the secret weapon that will revolutionize your coding game!</p>
        
        <img src="srp.jpg" alt="Single Responsibility Principle">
        
        <h2>What is the Single Responsibility Principle?</h2>
        <p>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, each class should have a single responsibility or purpose, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.</p>
        
        <p>By adhering to the SRP, your code becomes more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs.</p>
        
        <h2>Example in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at an example in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>
// Before applying SRP
class User {
    constructor(name, email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    saveToDatabase() {
        // Save user data to the database
    }

    sendEmail() {
        // Send welcome email to the user
    }

    generateReport() {
        // Generate user report
    }
}

// After applying SRP
class User {
    constructor(name, email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    saveToDatabase() {
        // Save user data to the database
    }
}

class EmailService {
    sendWelcomeEmail(user) {
        // Send welcome email to the user
    }
}

class ReportGenerator {
    generateUserReport(user) {
        // Generate user report
    }
}
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>By separating concerns and adhering to the SRP, your code becomes more flexible and easier to maintain. Say goodbye to spaghetti code and hello to clean, efficient code!</p>
        
        <p>Don't miss out on the opportunity to turbocharge your coding efficiency. Embrace the Single Responsibility Principle today and become the coding rockstar you were meant to be!</p>




<h2>Unleash the Power of the Open/Closed Principle - Elevate Your Code to New Heights!</h2>

  <p>Are you tired of constantly modifying and rewriting your code every time a new requirement comes in? Do you long for code that's resilient to change and easy to extend?</p>
        
        <p>Introducing the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - the game-changing principle that will take your code to the next level!</p>
        
        <img src="ocp.jpg" alt="Open/Closed Principle">
        
        <h2>What is the Open/Closed Principle?</h2>
        <p>The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to extend the behavior of a system without modifying its existing code.</p>
        
        <p>By adhering to the OCP, your code becomes more flexible, resilient, and easier to maintain.</p>
        
        <h2>Example in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at an example in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>
// Before applying OCP
class DiscountCalculator {
    calculateDiscount(amount) {
        if (amount > 100) {
            return amount * 0.2; // 20% discount
        } else {
            return amount * 0.1; // 10% discount
        }
    }
}

// After applying OCP
class DiscountCalculator {
    calculateDiscount(amount) {
        return amount * this.getDiscountPercentage();
    }

    getDiscountPercentage() {
        throw new Error('Method must be overridden in subclass');
    }
}

class TenPercentDiscount extends DiscountCalculator {
    getDiscountPercentage() {
        return 0.1; // 10% discount
    }
}

class TwentyPercentDiscount extends DiscountCalculator {
    getDiscountPercentage() {
        return 0.2; // 20% discount
    }
}
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>By adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, your code becomes more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Say goodbye to spaghetti code and hello to clean, extensible code!</p>
        
        <p>Don't miss out on the opportunity to elevate your coding skills. Embrace the Open/Closed Principle today and unlock the true potential of your code!</p>












   <h2>Unlock the Power of the Liskov Substitution Principle - Redefine Your Code Quality!</h2>

        <p>Are you tired of dealing with brittle, inflexible code that's impossible to extend or maintain? Do you dream of writing code that's robust, resilient, and easy to work with?</p>
        
        <p>Introducing the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - the secret weapon that will revolutionize your approach to object-oriented design!</p>
        
        <img src="lsp.jpg" alt="Liskov Substitution Principle">
        
        <h2>What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?</h2>
        <p>The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be able to extend the behavior of their parent classes without changing their behavior.</p>
        
        <p>By adhering to the LSP, your code becomes more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.</p>
        
        <h2>Example in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at an example in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>
// Before applying LSP
class Rectangle {
    constructor(width, height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    setWidth(width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

        this.width = width;
        this.height = width;
    }

    setHeight(height) {
        this.width = height;
        this.height = height;
    }
}

// After applying LSP
class Shape {

        throw new Error('Method must be overridden in subclass');
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(width, height) {
        super();
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    setWidth(width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    setHeight(height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    getArea() {
        return this.width * this.height;

  <h2>Unleash the Power of the Interface Segregation Principle - Revolutionize Your Code Architecture!</h2>
        <p>Are you tired of dealing with bloated interfaces that force you to implement methods you don't need? Do you long for interfaces that are tailored to your specific needs and nothing more?</p>
        
        <p>Introducing the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - the key to unlocking a more modular, flexible, and maintainable code architecture!</p>
        
        <img src="isp.jpg" alt="Interface Segregation Principle">
        
        <h2>What is the Interface Segregation Principle?</h2>
        <p>The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one large interface, it's better to have multiple smaller interfaces that are specific to the needs of the clients.</p>
        
        <p>By adhering to the ISP, your code becomes more modular, cohesive, and easier to maintain.</p>
        
        <h2>Example in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at an example in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>
// Before applying ISP
interface Worker {

<h2>Unleash the Power of the Dependency Inversion Principle - Transform Your Code Architecture!</h2>
        <p>Are you tired of dealing with tightly coupled code that's difficult to maintain and test? Do you long for code that's more flexible, scalable, and resilient to change?</p>
        
        <p>Introducing the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - the secret sauce that will revolutionize your code architecture and take your development skills to the next level!</p>
        
        <img src="dip.jpg" alt="Dependency Inversion Principle">
        
        <h2>What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?</h2>
        <p>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.</p>
        
        <p>By adhering to the DIP, your code becomes more decoupled, modular, and easier to maintain.</p>
