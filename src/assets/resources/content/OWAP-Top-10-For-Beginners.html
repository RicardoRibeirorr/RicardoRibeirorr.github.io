OWAP-Top-10-For-Beginners

<article>
        <h2>1. Injection</h2>
        <p>Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This can lead to the execution of unintended commands or unauthorized access to data. Common types include SQL injection, NoSQL injection, and LDAP injection.</p>
        <h3>Example of SQL Injection:</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(query);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <img src="injection.jpg" alt="Injection">
        
        <h2>2. Broken Authentication</h2>
        <p>Broken authentication vulnerabilities occur when attackers compromise user credentials or session tokens, enabling unauthorized access to user accounts. This can lead to account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and more.</p>
        <h3>Example of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
public void authenticateUser(String username, String password, String otpCode) {
    // Verify username and password
    // Verify OTP code
    // Allow access if all verifications pass
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <img src="authentication.jpg" alt="Broken Authentication">

        <h2>3. Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
        <p>Sensitive data exposure occurs when sensitive information is not adequately protected. This can include passwords, credit card numbers, health records, and more. When exposed, this data can be exploited by attackers for identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities.</p>
        <h3>Example of Encryption of Data-at-Rest:</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
AES256.encrypt(data, encryptionKey);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <img src="data-exposure.jpg" alt="Sensitive Data Exposure">

        <!-- More detailed explanations for other security risks -->

        <h2>4. XML External Entities (XXE)</h2>
        <p>XXE vulnerabilities occur when an application parses XML input, allowing attackers to access files on the server or interact with internal systems. This can lead to unauthorized data disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), and more.</p>
        <h3>Example of Disabling External Entity Processing:</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
factory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <img src="xxe.jpg" alt="XML External Entities (XXE)">
